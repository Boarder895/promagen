      "intro": "Polyethylene (PE) is the world's most produced plastic — over 100 million tonnes annually — used for packaging film, bottles, pipes, toys, and countless everyday items. Produced by polymerising ethylene monomer derived from cracking naphtha (oil-based) or ethane (natural-gas-based). Two main grades: HDPE (high-density, rigid — milk jugs, pipes) and LDPE/LLDPE (low-density, flexible — stretch wrap, plastic bags).

This makes PVC less oil-dependent than other plastics. Produced by polymerising vinyl chloride monomer (VCM). PVC comes in two forms: rigid (uPVC — pipes, window frames, profiles) and flexible (plasticised — cables, flooring, medical bags). China produces and consumes over 40% of global PVC. The construction industry consumes over 70% of PVC output.",
