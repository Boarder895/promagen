 * Placeholder test for a future /providers route.

 * to flip it to a real presence test once the page exists.
 *
 * When you add /providers, replace this with assertions like:
 *  - page file exists (app/providers/page.tsx)
 *  - nav link is visible & marked active on route
 *  - table renders using providers.json (schema-checked)
