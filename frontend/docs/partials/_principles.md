## Principles (the “5 things” + uniformity)
- **Functionality first** – ship features that work, safe and correct  
- **Modern, pleasing design** – clean UI polish  
- **Longevity** – maintainable code, stable stack  
- **Ease & simplicity** – low friction for devs & users  
- **Cost-effective scaling** – start lean, upgrade as revenue grows  
- **Uniformity** – consistent patterns, naming and UX
