## FX Eligibility (global catalog)

Paid-tier FX pairs are drawn from currencies present in the **global exchange catalog** (not just the exchanges currently on screen). The picker shows the full cross-pair universe from that set. Your visible rails influence **east→west ordering** only; they do not restrict availability. If no pairs are selected, the ribbon defaults to **GBP/EUR, GBP/USD, EUR/USD**.

**Pause contract.** The pause button freezes shimmer, data updates (API or pre-login simulation), and live-region announcements.

**Freshness.** Logged-out guests see a deterministic, tightly bounded random-walk seeded daily. Logged-in users get **hourly** snapshots, staggered by pair. UI always shows “as of HH:mm (local)”. If age > 60 minutes label “aging”; > 90 minutes label “delayed”.
